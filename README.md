📌 **Exercise Statement**

This module focuses on generic types in Java as a mechanism for writing reusable, type-safe code. The exercises explore generic classes and methods, type constraints, and flexible parameter handling while avoiding manual casting and reducing runtime errors.

**Level 1 — Generics Fundamentals**

This level introduces the basic use of generics in Java. The goal is to understand how Java provides flexible but safe typing when working with classes and methods that operate on different data types.

**Level 1 — Exercise 1: Non-Generic Class**

A class named `NoGenericMethods` is created to store three arguments of the same type. The class includes a constructor to initialize the values and getter methods to retrieve each element.

The constructor must allow the arguments to be passed in any order. This exercise serves as a reference point for later comparison with a generic implementation.

**Level 1 — Exercise 2: Generic Method with Multiple Parameters**

A `Person` class is created with the attributes `name`, `surname`, and `age`. A class named `GenericMethods` defines a generic method `printElements()` that accepts three generic parameters and prints them.

From the `main()` method, the generic method is invoked using different parameter types, such as a `Person` object, a `String`, and a primitive numeric value.

This exercise demonstrates that generic methods can accept any combination of types in any order.
